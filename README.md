## The Project

In this project, a .NET MVC application was built using good programming practices, such as clean architecture and SOLID principles. In addition to also using some design patterns such as Mapper, Command and Handlers for example.
The application was divided into seven different projects, they are:
- CleanArchMvc.API
- CleanArchMvc.Application
- CleanArchMvc.Domain
- CleanArchMvc.Domain.Tests
- CleanArchMvc.Infra.Data
- CleanArchMvc.Infra.IoC
- CleanArchMvc.WebUI

In the API layer, documentation was implemented with Swagger, requiring user authentication through a token that will be generated.

## Languages

- C#

  I would like to thank master Macoratti for the teachings passed on this project through his course explaining clean architecture. It was certainly a great learning     experience and benefit. I leave here the link directing you to your course if you are interested in learning new technologies, patterns and architectures on the     C#|.NET platform.
